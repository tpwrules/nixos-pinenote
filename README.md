[Stock PineNote Impressions (2022-01-02)](docs/initial-impressions.md)

## Credits

This is mostly a restructuring of work many others have already done, and it wouldn't have been possible without them. Important parts of the Linux on PineNote experience include:
* [smaeul's kernel e-ink driver and config](https://github.com/smaeul/linux/tree/rk356x-ebc-dev)
* [Rockchip's downstream U-Boot](https://github.com/Caesar-github/u-boot)
* [PINE64's downstream rkdeveloptool](https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/quartz-bsp/rkdeveloptool)
